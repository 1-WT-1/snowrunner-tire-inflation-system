// outside.h: the outside temperature and what it does to a tire. A gauge cluster mod by the same author works the
// temperature out by map and hour and publishes it for other mods in a block of shared memory,
// "Local\SnowRunnerGauges.State.<process id>", about 20 times a second; the layout below is its version 1. Without
// it, or with a block that stands still for kOutsideStaleMs, AmbientC from the ini is the outside temperature, and
// the block is looked for again every kOutsideLookMs. The block is copied while its sequence is even and unchanged,
// as the writer makes it odd while it writes. The writer's file is never touched: the mapping lives on while either
// side holds it, so there is never a pointer into a module that went away.
